# Hello-World
My first repository on Github.

I'm new to programming, and I started on Github because  I see now that it has recently become popular with programmers. I hope that I can use it as an excellent source to get some experience with projects and to sharpen some of my skills. I am knowlegable in python, javascript, and C++, yet I want to expand on each with projects I can do on Github.
